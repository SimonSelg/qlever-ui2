QLever UI2 enables an user to construct and perform SPARQL Queries against Wikidata in a visual, interactive way. This enables (non-technical) users, that may not have knowledge about Wikidata, SPARQL or knowledgebases, to perform searches against Wikidata.

QLever UI2 is the bachelor project I did at the [Chair of Algorithms and Data Structures of Prof. Dr. Hannah Bast](https://ad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/front-page-en?set_language=en) as part of my computer science studies at the [Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg](https://www.uni-freiburg.de/). It was supervised by [Prof. Hannah Bast](https://ad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/staff/bast)

## Project structure
- The `qlever-ui2-frontend` folder contains the frontend, which is just the UI
- The `qlever-ui2-backend` folder contains the backend service
