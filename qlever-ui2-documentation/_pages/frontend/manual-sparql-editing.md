You can view the SPARQL Query which is currently visualized by going to the "SPARQL" tab. 

![sparql query]({{"assets/screenshots/query-sparql.png" | relativize_url}})

You can also directly edit the query here. Your changes will be reflected in the visualisation on the left side instantly.

![sparql editing]({{"assets/screenshots/query-sparql-editing.png" | relativize_url}})

As soon as you make a change, the save/discard buttons will appear.
