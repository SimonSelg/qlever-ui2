It provides query visualization, an interactive query construction assistant and query execution using QLever.  It consists out of an User Interface (frontend) and a Backend Service (backend), which provides REST endpoints for the frontend.

### Requirements
To use QLever UI2, an user needs an up to date browser where javascript is enabled. The User Interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, but a tablet or desktop is recommend for the best experience.

In order for the backend to run, a QLever Backend and a WikidataFrontend need to be reachable. For details check the backend documentation.
